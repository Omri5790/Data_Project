## Project Overview
In this project, we explore hotel price behaviors on Booking.com and Expedia.com. We aim to:
- Scrape hotel price data.
- Explore and preprocess the data.
- Build and evaluate machine learning models to predict hotel prices.
- Analyze price differences between Booking.com and Expedia.com.
- Reverse engineer the sorting algorithms used by these websites.

## Data Collection
### Web Scraping
We used Python libraries like `Selenium` and `BeautifulSoup` to scrape hotel search results from Booking.com and Expedia.com. Our scraping criteria included:
- Location: New York
- Search Parameters: Various combinations of TTT (Time to Travel) and LOS (Length of Stay)
- Dates: Multiple snapshot dates to capture data diversity

We collected data on various attributes, including hotel name, rating, price, distance from city center, room type, cancellation policy, and more. 

## Data Exploration and Preprocessing
### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
We performed EDA to understand the distributions and relationships within our data:
- Distributions of review counts, ratings, and prices
- Identification and handling of outliers
- Conversion of ordinal and nominal variables into numerical formats using techniques like one-hot encoding

### Data Cleaning
We cleaned the data by:
- Removing outliers using the Tukey method
- Handling missing values and inconsistent data entries
- Normalizing and scaling the features for better model performance

## Price Prediction Models
We implemented several regression algorithms to predict hotel prices based on our collected data:
- Linear Regression
- Decision Tree Regressor
- Gaussian Process Regressor
- Random forest Regressor
- SVR
- Neural networks Regressor
  
We split our data into training and testing sets, experimented with various hyperparameters, and evaluated model performance using metrics such as MAE, MSE, RMSE, and RÂ².

## Price Difference Analysis
We built models to predict price differences between Booking.com and Expedia.com for identical hotel bookings. This involved:
- Identifying common hotels between the two platforms
- Using features from both websites to train the models
- Evaluating the models based on prediction accuracy and error metrics

## Reverse Engineering Sorting Algorithms
To understand how Booking.com and Expedia.com rank hotels in their search results, we:
- Developed algorithms to replicate the sorting mechanism
- Used machine learning techniques to analyze the impact of different features on hotel rankings
- Measured the algorithm's performance by comparing our predicted rankings with the actual ones

## Results and Findings
Our analysis provided insights into:
- Key factors influencing hotel prices
- Differences in pricing strategies between Booking.com and Expedia.com
- Effectiveness of various regression models in predicting prices
- Sorting criteria used by online travel agencies
